# Machine Learning for Essential Ocean Variables

The research project’s objective is to set up a framework in Python that applies a machine learning (ML) method to existing global datasets in the Pacific Ocean, which will have two functions:
•	The first function is to incorporate an additional essential ocean variable (EOV), specifically oxygen, into newly collected hydrographic profiles in the Nova Canton Trough (NCT).
•	To extend the depth (over 6000 m) of EOVs in the NCT region, which are historically collected to only 6000 m. 

Data/ Collected_data -> Pressure_temp = Data from RBRduets - temperature and pressure(depth)
Data/ Collected_data/Pressure_temp_salinity = Data from CTDs - temperature, pressure(depth) and salinity - only "good" data included here
